# About #
This repository shares two R files we used to 1) conduct meta-analysis and 2) create the PRISMA flow diagram.
The SchoolBasedMentalHealth_Analysis.R was used to run meta-regression and generate result tables.
PRISMA.R and PRISMA.dot together were used to create Prisma flow diagrams.

In addition, we share our data file where we coded our included studies. This file is called School-based Mental Health Interventions.xlsx.
To run the R analysis file, you need to read the excel data file.
